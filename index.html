    <h1>The Defence of Jola Prime</h1>
    <p>This is a 2D platformer game based on a galactic defence ship. The Invaders have come and you need to defeat them
        to save the galaxy. The player character can run, jump and shoot bullets at the cursor's location. These bullets
        can be used
        to kill enemies and also solve certain platforming challenges. The inspiration for this game came from other 2D
        platformers in the industry such as: Hollow Knight, Shovel Knight and Spelunky. These games combined enjoyable
        platforming with difficult enemies and nice level design.
